<p>Sorry. This feature is only available to registered <q>backup</q> users of
the site.</p>

<p>Okay, you're almost ready to upload photos by email to Flickr. By default
<strong>{$cfg.site_name|escape}</strong> only needs to have an authentication
token for your Flickr account ({$cfg.user.username|escape}) with <q>read</q>
permissions. In order to upload photos we'll need to bounce you back through the
Flickr website site so you can confirm that you're okay with
<strong>{$cfg.site_name|escape}</strong> uploading photos on your behalf.</p>

<p><a href="{$cfg.abs_root_url}account/flickr/auth?perms=write&redir=/account/uploadbyemail/">Get started.</a></p>
